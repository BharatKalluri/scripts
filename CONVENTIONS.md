- we use uv for package management. to add a package, do `uv add packagename`
- prefer pure functions over impure functions always, move the impure implementation always into the orchestration layer.
- try and keep the function size below 50 lines
- for making cli apps, use the typer library with type annotations
- always annotate types for all variables, function arguments and return types
