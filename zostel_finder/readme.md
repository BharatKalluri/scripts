# Zostel finder

## Why?

If I want to go somewhere this weekend and am looking for ideas on which zostel I can pay a visit, zostel expects me to
go one by one and look for availability for particular dates. Why?

## How to run?

Make an availability request from browser, find the corresponding request and pick the user ID, app ID and token from
that API endpoint. Pass them to the cli and it should output zostels free in that time range. Happy journey!
